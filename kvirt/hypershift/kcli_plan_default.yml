    Deploys an hypershift cluster with an arbitray number of workers
    It relies on a valid KUBECONFIG env variable pointing to a cluster where hypershift operator is running
    version can be stable, dev-preview, nightly, ci or cluster (which means picking the version from top cluster)
    autosigning csrs for workers is handled with a cronjob running on the top cluster in the dedicated namespace
    ingress_ip is required for virt platforms to provide a way to access apps from the outside.
    The vip will be running through a dedicated keepalived static pod
