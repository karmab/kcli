    Deploys an hypershift cluster with an arbitray number of workers
    It relies on a valid KUBECONFIG env variable pointing to a cluster where hypershift operator is running
    version can be latest, stable, candidate, nightly, ci or cluster.
    you can also set version for hosted_cluster to cluster so that it uses the top cluster version.
    A mandatory default storage class is checked at the beginning of the workflow
    Hypershift will also be installed on the management cluster if missing, either from latest container using podman or through MCE
    autosigning csrs for workers is handled with a cronjob running on the top cluster in the dedicated namespace
    ingress_ip is required for virt platforms to provide a way to access apps from the outside.
    The vip will be running through a dedicated keepalived static pod.
    For deploying with baremetal workers, a baremetal_hosts array needs to be configured
    Although the default platform uses the none workflow, you can set it to assisted or kubevirt
    With platform kubevirt, the vms will be created directly via kubevirt hypershift integration in the hosted cluster namespace
    With platform assisted, you will need to provision vms via a preliminary step (or use baremetal nodes) and still define baremetal_hosts array
    or you can use the assisted_vms flags to have vms provision for you
