    Deploys an openshift cluster with an arbitray number of ctlplanes or workers using openshift-install
    and creating the nodes with kcli.
    This allows easily tweaking the hardware caracteristics of those nodes.
    When running on cloud platforms, loadbalancer and dns from the platform are used.
    Otherwise, extra static pods (coredns with mdns, keepalived and haproxy) are deployed on the nodes to provide a self contained platform.
    flags exist to disable those components if you are already meeting requirements
    Default version is stable but you can use dev-preview, nightly or ci instead, for which you will need a specific pull secret.
    When providing a DNS domain, either use one with correct DNS entries or with fake ones, avoid .com domain
    Sdn defaults to OVNKubernetes but OpenShiftSDN, Cilium or Calico can be selected.
    To avoid keepalived collision, you can force virtual_router_id. Otherwise, the id is calculated from cluster variable.
    You can deploy extra apps with the apps array and for each of the supported app, indicate with the variable
    ${app}_version which version to target (instead of latest).
    You can also define a list of scripts to launch at the end with the postscripts array.
    You can force the kubernetes ip of the nodes (and the vips allocation) to use a specific network by setting baremetal_cidr
    For deploying a single node cluster, you can simply set ctplanes to 1 and workers to 0, or use the flag sno to leverage
    bootstrap in place (which removes the need for a bootstrap vm). This approach is suitable for baremetal single node
    baremetal_hosts can be specified as an array of bmc urls to deploy baremetal workers (or in the case of SNO described before)
