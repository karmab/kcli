autostart: Autostart vm (libvirt)
base: |
  Allows you to point to a parent profile so that values are taken from parent when not found in the current profile.
  Scripts and commands are rather concatenated between default, father and children
client: Allows to target a different client/host for the corresponding entry
cloudinit: |
  Generate cloudinit data to inject to the vm.
  On libvirt, the data is provided through a $vm.ISO iso plugged to the node.
  On other platforms, the corresponding field is used to pass this information
cmdline: |
  Cmdline to pass to the vm (libvirt)
  This is used along with a combination of kernel and initrd parameter to allow kickstarting a node.
  If doing so, the kernel and initrd will have to be removed from vm domain definition
  Alternatively, it can be applied by itself to rhcos nodes to force the cmdline through virt-edit.
  This is useful to force a rhcos node to boot to ipv6 by passing ip=dhcp6 or to specify a static network configuration through dracut arguments
cmds: Array of commands to run through cloudinit or ignition
cpuflags: |
  You can specify a list of strings with features to enable or use dict entries with name of the feature and policy either set to require,disable, optional or force.

disks: |
  Array of disks to define.
  For each of them, you can specify pool, size, thin (as boolean), interface (either ide or virtio) and a wwn.

insecure: Handles all the ssh option details so you don't get any warnings about man in the middle
iso: |
  Iso to plug to the node
  Can either be 
    an iso stored in one of the pools
    a remote url which will get downloaded on the fly

memoryhotplug: Whether to allow Memory hotplugging (libvirt)
nested: Whether to allow nested
netmasks: netmasks to use in cloudinit/ignition with static networking
nets: |
  Array of networks to define.
  For each of them, you can specify just a string for the name, or a dict containing name, public and alias and ip, mask and gateway, and bridge.
  Any visible network is valid, in particular bridge networks can be used on libvirt, beyond regular nat networks
networkwait: Delay in seconds before attempting to run further commands, to be used in environments where networking takes more time to come up
notify: Sends result of a command or a script run from the vm to one of the supported notify engines
notifycmd: |
  Which command to run for notification.
  If none is provided and no notifyscript either, defaults to sending last 100 lines of the cloudinit file of the machine, or ignition for coreos based vms
