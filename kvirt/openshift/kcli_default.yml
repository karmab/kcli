    Deploys an openshift cluster with an arbitray number of masters or workers using openshift-install
    and creating the node with kcli instead of terraforms.
    This allows easily tweaking the hardware caracteristics of those nodes.
    When running on cloud platforms, loadbalancer and dns from the platform is used.
    Otherwise, extra static pods (coredns with mdns, keepalived and haproxy) are deployed on the nodes to provide a self contained platform.
    Default version is latest stable but you can instead use ci, for which you will need a specific pull secret
    Upstream okd version can be specified with the upstream flag.
    Sdn defaults to OpenShiftSDN but OVNKubernetes, Calico or Contrail can be specified instead.
    To avoid keepalived collision, you can force virtual_router_id. Otherwise, the id is calculated from cluster variable
    You can deploy extra apps with the apps array and for each of the supported app, indicate with the variable
    ${app}_version with version to target (instead of latest)
    You can also define a list of scripts to launch at the end with the postscripts array.
