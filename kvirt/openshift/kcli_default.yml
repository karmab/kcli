    Deploys an openshift cluster with an arbitray number of ctlplanes or workers using openshift-install
    and creating the node with kcli instead of terraforms.
    This allows easily tweaking the hardware caracteristics of those nodes.
    When running on cloud platforms, loadbalancer and dns from the platform is used.
    Otherwise, extra static pods (coredns with mdns, keepalived and haproxy) are deployed on the nodes to provide a self contained platform.
    Default version is latest stable but you can instead use ci, for which you will need a specific pull secret
    Upstream okd version can be specified with the upstream flag.
    the baremetal flag allows to get the baremetal operator deployed, so that you can deploy physical workers afterwards.
    Sdn defaults to OpenShiftSDN but OVNKubernetes or Calico can be specified instead.
    You can deploy extra apps with the apps array and for each of the supported app, indicate with the variable
    ${app}_version with version to target (instead of latest)
