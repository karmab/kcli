    when using more than a master, a vip is used with keepalived
    default image is centos8, but there's also support for ubuntu based ones
    version can be let blank to get latest, or specified as x.yy or x.yy.z
    sdn can be choosen between flannel, weavenet, calico, canal or romana
    nfs can be set to deploy an initial set of pvcs on the first master node
    You can deploy extra apps with the apps array and for each of the supported app, indicate with the variable
    ${app}_version with version to target (instead of latest)
