    default image is centos8stream, but there's also support for ubuntu based ones and fedora
    version can be let blank to get latest, or specified as x.yy or x.yy.z
    sdn can be choosen between flannel, weavenet, calico, canal, romana or cilium
    nfs can be set to deploy an initial set of pvcs on the first master node
    You can deploy extra apps with the apps array and for each of the supported app, indicate with the variable
    ${app}_version with version to target (instead of latest)
