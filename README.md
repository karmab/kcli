This tool is meant to interact with a local/remote libvirt daemon and to easily deploy from templates (using cloudinit).
It will also report IPS for any vm connected to a dhcp-enabled libvirt network and generally for every vm deployed from this client.
Futhermore, you can deploy vms using defined profiles or several at once using plans
There is support for gcp, aws, kubevirt and ovirt 

Refer to the [documentation](https://kcli.readthedocs.io) for more information

## [ChangeLog](https://github.com/karmab/kcli/wiki)

##  What you can do

- Interact with libvirt without XML
- Declare all your objects(vm, containers, networks, ansible,...) in a single yaml file!
- Easily grab and share those files from github
- Easily Test all Red Hat Infrastructure products, and their upstream counterparts
- Easily share private keys between your vms
- Inject all configuration with cloudinit
- Use the default cloud images
- Use a web UI to do it too
- Do all of this in additional providers(gcp, aws, kubevirt, ovirt) using same commands and files
