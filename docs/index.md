# About

This tool is meant to ease interaction with virtualization providers:

* libvirt
* kubevirt
* ovirt
* vsphere
* openstack
* gcp
* aws
* packet
* ibmcloud

You can: 

- manage those vms:
   - create
   - delete
   - list
   - info
   - ssh
   - start
   - stop
   - console
   - serialconsole,
   - create/delete disk
   - create/delete nic
   - clone
- deploy them using profiles
- define more complex workflows using *plans* and products.

The tool can also deploy kubernetes clusters:

- kubernetes generic (kubeadm)
- openshift
- okd
- k3s

# Installation

## Libvirt Hypervisor Requisites

If you don't have libvirt installed on the target hypervisor, you can use the following command to get you going:

```bash
sudo yum -y install libvirt libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu qemu-kvm 
sudo usermod -aG qemu,libvirt $(id -un)
sudo newgrp libvirt
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
```

(Optional) For interaction with your local docker daemon, you also need the following:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker YOUR_USER
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Supported installation methods


The following methods are supported for installation and are all updated automatically when new pushes to kcli are made.

- rpm package
- deb package
- container image
- pypi package

## Installing

The script can also be used for installation, which will make a guess on which method to use for deployment based on your OS, and also create the proper aliases if container method is selected, and set bash completion).


```Shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karmab/kcli/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

## Package install method

If using *fedora* or *rhel/centos8*,  you can run this as root:

```bash
sudo dnf -y copr enable karmab/kcli ; sudo dnf -y install kcli
```

If using a debian based distribution, you can use this :

```bash
curl -1sLf https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/karmab/kcli/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh | sudo -E bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install python3-kcli
```

The package version doesn't bundle the dependencies for anything else than libvirt, so you have to install the extra packages for each additional cloud platforms, which are listed in the *Provider specifics* section.

Alternatively, the repo contains a meta package named kcli-all (python3-kcli-all in the debian case) that contains dependencies for all the providers.

*NOTE*: kcli-all is only available on fedora.

## Container install method

Note that 

- The container image contains dependencies for all the providers.
- The console/serial console functionality works better with the package version. In container mode, it only outputs the command to launch manually to get to the console.

In the commands below, use either docker or podman 

Pull the latest image:

```Shell
docker pull quay.io/karmab/kcli
```

To run it

```Shell
docker run --rm karmab/kcli
```

There are several recommended flags:

- `--net host` for kcli ssh
- `-v /var/run/libvirt:/var/run/libvirt -v /var/lib/libvirt/images:/var/lib/libvirt/images` if running against a local client.
- `-v  ~/.kcli:/root/.kcli` to use your kcli configuration (also profiles and repositories) stored locally.
- `-v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh` to share your ssh keys. Alternatively, you can store your public and private key in the ~/.kcli directory.
- `--security-opt label=disable` if running with selinux.
- `-v $PWD:/workdir` to access plans below your current directory.
- `-v $HOME:/root` to share your entire home directory, useful if you want to share secret files, `~/register.sh` for instance).
- `-e HTTP_PROXY=your_proxy -e HTTPS_PROXY=your_proxy`
- `-v ~/.kube:/root/.kube` to share your kubeconfig.

For web access, you can switch with `-p 9000:9000 --entrypoint=/usr/bin/kweb` and thus accessing to port 9000.

As a bonus, you can use the following aliases:

```Shell
alias kcli='docker run --net host -it --rm --security-opt label=disable -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v $HOME/.kcli:/root/.kcli -v /var/lib/libvirt/images:/var/lib/libvirt/images -v /var/run/libvirt:/var/run/libvirt -v $PWD:/workdir quay.io/karmab/kcli'
alias kclishell='docker run --net host -it --rm --security-opt label=disable -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v $HOME/.kcli:/root/.kcli -v /var/lib/libvirt/images:/var/lib/libvirt/images -v /var/run/libvirt:/var/run/libvirt -v $PWD:/workdir --entrypoint=/bin/bash quay.io/karmab/kcli'
alias kweb='docker run -p 9000:9000 --net host -it --rm --security-opt label=disable -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v $HOME/.kcli:/root/.kcli -v /var/lib/libvirt/images:/var/lib/libvirt/images -v /var/run/libvirt:/var/run/libvirt -v $PWD:/workdir --entrypoint=/usr/bin/kweb quay.io/karmab/kcli'
```

## Dev installation

### Generic platform

```Shell
pip install kcli
```

Or for a full install:

```
pip install -e git+https://github.com/karmab/kcli.git#egg=kcli[all]
```

# Configuration

If you only want to use your local libvirt, *no specific configuration* is needed.

kcli configuration is done in ~/.kcli directory, that you need to manually create. It will contain:

- config.yml generic configuration where you declare clients.
- profiles.yml stores your profiles where you combine things like memory, numcpus and all supported parameters into named profiles to create vms from.
- id\_rsa/id\_rsa.pub/id\_dsa/id\_dsa.pub/id\_25519/id\_25519.pub You can store your default public and private keys in *.kcli* directory which will be the first place to look for them when connecting to a remote kvm hypervisor, virtual machine or when injecting your public key.

You can generate a default config file (with all parameters commented) pointing to your local host with:
    
```Shell
kcli create host kvm -H 127.0.0.1 local
```

Or indicate a different target host

```Shell
kcli create host -H 192.168.0.6 host1
```

On most distributions, default network and storage pool for libvirt are already defined.

If needed, you can create this default storage pool with this:

```Shell
sudo kcli create pool -p /var/lib/libvirt/images default
sudo setfacl -m u:$(id -un):rwx /var/lib/libvirt/images
```

And default network:

```Shell
kcli create network  -c 192.168.122.0/24 default
```

For using several hypervisors, you can use the command *kcli create host* or simply edit your configuration file.

For instance, here's a sample `~/.kcli/config.yml` with two hypervisors:

```YAML
default:
 client: mycli
 pool: default
 numcpus: 2
 memory: 1024
 disks:
  - size: 10
 protocol: ssh
 nets:
  - default

mycli:
 host: 192.168.0.6
 pool: default

bumblefoot:
 host: 192.168.0.4
 pool: whatever
```

Replace with your own client in default section and indicate the relevant parameters in the corresponding client section, depending on your client/host type.

Most of the parameters are actually optional, and can be overridden in the default, client or profile section (or in a plan file).
You can find a fully detailed config.yml sample [here](https://github.com/karmab/kcli/tree/master/samples/config.yml)

## Storing credentials securely

You can hide your secrets in *~/.kcli/config.yml* by replacing any value by *?secret*. You can then place the real value in *~/.kcli/secrets.yml* by using the same yaml hierarchy.

For instance, if you have the following in your config file:

```
xxx:
 password: ?secret
```

You would then put the real password in your secrets file this way:

```
xxx:
 password: mypassword
```

# Provider specifics

## Libvirt

```
twix:
 type: kvm
 host: 192.168.1.6
```

Without configuration, libvirt provider tries to connect locally using qemu:///system.

Additionally, remote libvirt hypervisors can be configured by indicating either a host, a port and protocol or a custom qemu url.

When using the host, port and protocol combination, default protocol uses ssh and as such assumes you are able to connect without password to your remote libvirt instance.

If using tcp protocol instead, you will need to configure libvirtd in your remote libvirt hypervisor to accept insecure remote connections.

You will also likely want to indicate default libvirt pool to use (although as with all parameters, it can be done in the default section).

The following parameters are specific to libvirt:

- url custom qemu uri.
- session Defaults to False. If you want to use qemu:///session ( locally or remotely). Not recommended as it complicates access to the vm and is supposed to have lower performance.
- remotednsmasq Defaults to False. Allow to create entries in a dedicated dnsmasq instance running on a remote hypervisor to provide DNS resolution for vms using bridged networks.

## Gcp

```
gcp1:
 type: gcp
 credentials: ~/myproject.json
 project: myproject
 zone: europe-west1-b
```

The following parameters are specific to gcp:

- credentials (pointing to a json service account file). if not specified, the environment variable *GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS* will be used
- project 
- zone

also note that gcp provider supports creation of dns records for an existing domain and that your home public key will be uploaded if needed

To gather your service account file:

- Select the "IAM" → "Service accounts" section within the Google Cloud Platform console.
- Select "Create Service account".
- Select "Project" → "Editor" as service account Role.
- Select "Furnish a new private key".
- Select "Save".

To Create a dns zone:

- Select the "Networking" → "Network Services" → "Cloud DNS".
- Select "Create Zone".
- Put the same name as your domain, but with '-' instead.

If accessing behind a proxy, be sure to set *HTTPS_PROXY* environment variable to `http://your_proxy:your_port`

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you'll need to install (from pip):

- *google-api-python-client*
- *google-auth-httplib2*
- *google-cloud-dns*

## Aws

```
aws:
 type: aws
 access_key_id: AKAAAAAAAAAAAAA
 access_key_secret: xxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyy
 region: eu-west-3
 keypair: mykey
```

The following parameters are specific to aws:

- access_key_id
- access_key_secret
- region
- keypair 
- session_token

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you'll need to install *python3-boto3* rpm

## Kubevirt

For kubevirt, you will need to define one ( or several !) sections with the type kubevirt in your *~/.kcli/config.yml*

Authentication is either handled by your local ~/.kubeconfig (kcli will try to connect to your current kubernetes/openshift context or with specific token:

```
kubevirt:
 type: kubevirt
```

You can use additional parameters for the kubevirt section:

- kubeconfig: kubeconfig file path
- context: the k8s context to use.
- pool: your default storageclass. can also be set as blank, if no storage class should try to bind pvcs.
- host: k8s api node .Also used for tunneling ssh.
- port: k8s api port.
- ca_file: optional certificate path.
- token: token, either from user or service account.
- tags: additional list of tags in a key=value format to put to all created vms in their *nodeSelector*. Can be further indicated at profile or plan level in which case values are combined. This provides an easy way to force vms to run on specific nodes, by matching labels.
- cdi: whether to use cdi. Defaults to true. A check on whether cdi is actually present will be performed.
- registry: Registry where to pull containerdisk images. Defaults to none, in which case your configured registries will be used.
- access_mode: Way to access vms other ssh. Defaults to NodePort,in which case a svc with a nodeport pointing to the ssh port of the vm will be created. Otherpossible values are LoadBalancer to create a svc of type loadbalancer to point to the vm or External to connect using the sdn ip of the vm. If tunnel options are set, they take precedence
- volume_mode: Volume Mode. Defaults to Filesystem (Block can be specified instead).
- volume_access: Volume access mode. Defaults to ReadWriteOnce.
- disk_hotplug: Whether to allow to hotplug (and unplug) disks. Defaults to false. Note it also requires to enable The HotplugVolumes featureGate within Kubevirt

You can use the following indications to gather context, create a suitable service account and retrieve its associated token:

To list the context at your disposal
```
kubectl config view -o jsonpath='{.contexts[*].name}'
```

To create a service account and give it privileges to handle vms,

```
SERVICEACCOUNT=xxx
kubectl create serviceaccount $SERVICEACCOUNT -n default
kubectl create clusterrolebinding $SERVICEACCOUNT --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=system:serviceaccount:default:$SERVICEACCOUNT
```

To gather a token (in /tmp/token):

```
SERVICEACCOUNT=xxx
SECRET=`kubectl get sa $SERVICEACCOUNT -o jsonpath={.secrets[0].name}`
kubectl get secret $SECRET -o jsonpath={.data.token} | base64 -d
```

on openshift, you can simply use

```
oc whoami -t
```

*kubectl* is currently a hard requirement for consoles

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you'll need to install *python3-kubernetes* rpm

## Ovirt

```
myovirt:
 type: ovirt
 host: ovirt.default
 user: admin@internal
 password: prout
 datacenter: Default
 cluster: Default
 pool: Default
 org: YourOrg
 ca_file: ~/ovirt.pem
```

The following parameters are specific to ovirt:

- org Organization 
- ca_file Points to a local path with the cert of the ovirt engine host. It can be retrieved with 
`curl "http://$HOST/ovirt-engine/services/pki-resource?resource=ca-certificate&format=X509-PEM-CA" > ~/.kcli/ovirt.pem`
- cluster  Defaults to Default
- datacenter Defaults to Default
- filtervms Defaults to True. Only list vms created by kcli.
- filteruser Defaults to False. Only list vms created by own user
- filtertag Defaults to None. Only list vms created by kcli with the corresponding filter=filtertag in their description. Useful for environments when you share the same user

Note that pool in Ovirt context refers to storage domain.

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you'll need to install

- http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release-master.rpm
- python3-ovirt-engine-sdk4

### Deploying Ovirt dependencies with pip

You will need to get *ovirt-engine-sdk-python* . On fedora, for instance, you would run:

```
dnf -y copr enable karmab/kcli
yum -y install kcli gcc redhat-rpm-config python3-devel openssl-devel libxml2-devel libcurl-devel
export PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=openssl
pip3 install ovirt-engine-sdk-python
```

On rhel, set PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY to nss instead

If you install manually from pip, you might need to install pycurl manually with the following line (and get openssl-dev headers)

```
pip install --no-cache-dir --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" --global-option="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"  pycurl
```

## Openstack

```
myopenstack:
 type: openstack
 user: testk
 password: testk
 project: testk
 domain: Default
 auth_url: http://openstack:5000/v3
 ca_file: ~/ca-trust.crt
```

The following parameters are specific to openstack:

- auth_url
- project
- domain. Defaults to *Default*
- ca_file (Optional)
- external_network (Optional). Indicates which network use for floating ips (useful when you have several ones)
- region_name (Optional). Used in OVH Openstack

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you'll need to install the following rpms 

- *python3-keystoneclient*
- *python3-glanceclient*
- *python3-cinderclient*
- *python3-neutronclient*
- *python3-novaclient*
- *python3-swiftclient*

## Vsphere

```
myvsphere:
 type: vsphere
 host: xxx-vcsa67.vcenter.e2e.karmalabs.com
 user: administrator@karmalabs.com
 password: mypassword
 datacenter: Madrid
 cluster: xxx
 filtervms: true
 pool: mysuperdatastore

```

The following parameters are specific to vsphere:

- cluster. 
- datacenter Defaults to Default
- filtervms Defaults to True. Only list vms created by kcli. Useful for environments when you are superadmin and have a ton of vms!!!
- category: Defaults to kcli. Category where to create tags in order to apply them to vms. If tags are requested for a given vm, they will be created on the fly along with the category, if missing
- basefolder: Optional base folder where to create all vms
- dvs: Whether to gather DVS networks. Enabled by default, but can be set to False to speed up operations if you don't have dvs networks

Note that pool in Vsphere context refers to datastore.

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you'll need to install *python3-pyvmomi* and *python3-requests*

### Using hostgroups and vm-host rules

The requisite is to create the hostgroup by yourself so that you can associate your hosts to it.

Then, when creating a vm, one can provide 3 extra parameters:

vmgroup: if it doesn't exist, the group will be created and in any case, the vm will get added to it.

hostgroup and hostrule: if both are provided and the hostrule doesnt exist, it will be created as affinity rule with the vmgroup and the hostgroup to it.

Note that when using this within a plan (or a cluster), it's enough to provide hostgroup and hostrule for the first vm of the plan so that the hostrule gets created ( though a kcli vmrule for instance), and vmgroup for all of them, so that the group gets created with the first vm, and then the remaining vm only get added.

Also note that vmgroups and hostrules dont get deleted along with vms (to ease recreation of the same assets)

### Using vm anti affinity rules

Within a plan, you can set the keyword `antipeers` to a list of vms which should never land on the same esx host.
When the last vm from this list gets created, the corresponding anti affinity rule will be created (and vsphere will relocate the other vms accordingly)

## Packet

```
myvpacket:
  type: packet
  auth_token: xxxx
  project: kcli
  facility: ams1
  tunnelhost: wilibonka.mooo.com
```

The following parameters are specific to packet:

- auth_token. 
- project
- facility. Can be omitted in which case you will have to specify on which facility to deploy vms.
- tunnelhost. Optional. When creating vms using ignition, the generated ignition file will be copied to the tunnelhost so it can be served (typically via web)
- tunneldir. Where to copy the ignition files when using a tunnelhost. Defaults to */var/www/html*

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you'll need to install packet-python from pip.

## IBM Cloud

```
myibm:
  type: ibm
  iam_api_key: xxxx
  region: eu-gb
  zone: eu-gb-2
  vpc: pruebak
```

The following parameters are specific to ibm cloud:

- iam_api_key. 
- region
- zone
- vpc. Default vpc
- cos_api_key. Optional Cloud object storage apikey
- cos_resource_instance_id. Optional Cloud object storage resource_instance_id (something like "crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloud-object-storage:global:a/yyy:xxxx::"). Alternatively you can provide the resource name
- cos_resource_instance_id. Optional Cis resource_instance_id used for DNS. Alternatively, you can provide the resource name

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you'll need to install the following packets from pip:

- ibm_vpc
- ibm-cos-sdk
- ibm-platform-services
- ibm-cloud-networking-services
- cos-aspera (optional)

# Usage

## Basic workflow

Cloud Images from common distros aim to be the primary source for your vms
*kcli download image* can be used to download a specific cloud image. for instance, centos7:

```Shell
kcli download image centos7
```

at this point, you can deploy vms directly from the template, using default settings for the vm:

```Shell
kcli create vm -i centos7 vm1
```

By default, your public key will be injected (using cloudinit) to the vm.

You can then access the vm using *kcli ssh*.

Kcli uses the default ssh_user according to the [cloud image](http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html).
To guess it, kcli checks the image name. So for example, your centos image must contain the term "centos" in the file name,
otherwise "root" is used.

Using parameters, you can tweak the vm creation. All keywords can be used. For instance:

```Shell
kcli create vm -i centos7 -P memory=2048 -P numcpus=2 vm1
```

You can also pass disks, networks, cmds (or any keyword, really):

```Shell
kcli create vm -i centos7 -P disks=[10,20] -P nets=[default,default] -P cmds=[yum -y install nc] vm1
```

You can use the following to get a list of available keywords, and their default value


```Shell
kcli get keyword
```

## Profiles configuration

Instead of passing parameters this way, you can use profiles.

Profiles are meant to help creating single vm with preconfigured settings (number of CPUS, memory, size of disk, network, whether to use a template, extra commands to run on start, whether reserving dns,....)

You use the file *~/.kcli/profiles.yml* to declare your profiles. Here's a snippet declaring the profile `centos`:

```
mycentos:
 image: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
 numcpus: 2
 disks:
  - size: 10
 reservedns: true
 nets:
  - name: default
 cmds:
  - echo unix1234 | passwd --stdin root
```

With this section, you can use the following to create a vm

```Shell
kcli create vm -p mycentos myvm
```

Note that when you download a given cloud image, a minimal associated profile is created for you.

## Cloudinit/Ignition support

Cloudinit is enabled by default and handles static networking configuration, hostname setting, injecting ssh keys and running specific commands and entire scripts, and copying entire files.

For vms based on coreos, ignition is used instead of cloudinit although the syntax is the same. If $name.ign or $plan.ign are found in the current directory, their content will be merged. The extension .cloudinit does the same for cloudinit.

To ease openshift deployment, when a node has a name in the \$cluster-role-\$num, where role can either be master, worker or bootstrap, additional paths are searched, namely \$cluster-\$role.ign, clusters/\$cluster/\$role.ign and \$HOME/.kcli/clusters/\$cluster/\$role.ign

For ignition support on ovirt, you will need a version of ovirt >= 4.3.4. Note that this requires to use an openstack based rhcos image.

## Typical commands

- List vms
  - `kcli list vm`
- List cloud images
  - `kcli list images `
- Create vm from a profile named base7
  - `kcli create vm -p base7 myvm`
- Create vm from profile base7 on a specific client/host named twix
  - `kcli -C twix create vm -p base7 myvm`
- Delete vm
  - `kcli delete vm vm1`
- Do the same without having to confirm
  - `kcli delete vm vm1 --yes`
- Get detailed info on a specific vm
  - `kcli info vm vm1`
- Start vm
  - `kcli start vm vm1` 
- Stop vm
  - `kcli stop vm vm1`
- Switch active client/host to bumblefoot
  - `kcli switch host bumblefoot`
- Get remote-viewer console
  - `kcli console vm vm1`
- Get serial console (over TCP). Requires the vms to have been created with kcli and netcat client installed on hypervisor
  - `kcli console vm -s vm1`
- Deploy multiple vms using plan x defined in x.yml file
  - `kcli create plan -f x.yml x`
- Delete all vm from plan x
  - `kcli delete plan x`
- Add 5GB disk to vm1, using pool named images
  - `kcli create vm-disk -s 5 -p images vm1`
- Delete disk named vm1_2.img from vm1
  - `kcli delete disk --vm vm1 vm1_2.img`
- Update memory in vm1 to 2GB memory
  - `kcli update vm -P memory=2048 vm1`
- Clone vm1 to new vm2
  - `kcli clone vm -b vm1 vm2`
- Connect with ssh to vm vm1
  - `kcli ssh vm vm1`
- Create a new network
  - `kcli create network -c 192.168.7.0/24 mynet`
- Create new pool
  - `kcli create pool -t dir -p /hom/images images`
- Add a new nic from network default to vm1
  - `kcli create nic -n default vm1`
- Delete nic eth2 from vm
  - `kcli delete nic -i eth2 vm1`
- Create snapshot named snap1 for vm1:
  - `kcli create snapshot vm -n vm1 snap1`
- Get info on your kvm setup
  - `kcli info host`
- Export vm:
  - `kcli export vm vm1`
- Run workflow script named myworkflow.sh with some parameters:
  - `kcli create workflow myworkflow.sh -P xx=jimi`

## Omitting vm's name
 
When you don't specify a vm, the last one created by kcli on the corresponding client is used (the list of the vms created is stored in *~/.kcli/vm*)

So for instance, you can simply use the following command to access your vm:

`kcli ssh`

## How to use the web version

Launch the following command and access your machine at port 9000:

```Shell
kweb
```

## Multiple clients

If you have multiple hypervisors/clients, you can generally use the flag *-C $CLIENT* to point to a specific one.

You can also use the following to list the vms of all your hosts/clients:
 
`kcli -C all list vm`

# plans

You can also define *plan* which are files in yaml with a list of profiles, vms, disks, and networks and vms to deploy.

The following types can be used within a plan:

- vm (this is the type used when none is specified)
- image
- network
- disk
- pool
- profile
- ansible
- container
- dns
- plan (so you can compose plans from several urls)
- kube
- workflow

## plan types

Here are some examples of each type (more examples can be found in this [samples repo ](https://github.com/karmab/kcli-plan-samples)):

### network

```YAML
mynet:
 type: network
 cidr: 192.168.95.0/24
```
You can also use the boolean keyword *dhcp* (mostly to disable it) and isolated . When not specified, dhcp and nat will be enabled

### image

```YAML
CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2:
 type: image
 url: http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
```

If you point to an url not ending in qcow2/qc2 (or img), your browser will be opened for you to proceed.
Also note that you can specify a command with the *cmd* key, so that virt-customize is used on the template once it's downloaded.

### disk

```YAML
share1.img:
 type: disk
 size: 5
 pool: vms
 vms:
  - centos1
  - centos2
```

Here the disk is shared between two vms (that typically would be defined within the same plan):

### pool

```YAML
mypool:
  type: pool
  path: /home/mypool
```

### profile

```YAML
myprofile:
  type: profile
  template: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
  memory: 3072
  numcpus: 1
  disks:
   - size: 15
   - size: 12
  nets:
   - default
  pool: default
```

### ansible

```YAML
myplay:
 type: ansible
 verbose: false
 playbook: prout.yml
 groups:
   nodes:
   - node1
   - node2
   masters:
   - master1
   - master2
   - master3
```

An inventory will be created for you in /tmp and that *group_vars* and *host_vars* directory are taken into account.
You can optionally define your own groups, as in this example.
The playbooks are launched in alphabetical order

### container

```YAML
centos:
 type: container
  image: centos
  cmd: /bin/bash
  ports:
   - 5500
  volumes:
   - /root/coco
```
Look at the container section for details on the parameters

### plan's plan ( Also known as inception style)

```YAML
ovirt:
  type: plan
  url: github.com/karmab/kcli-plans/ovirt/upstream.yml
  run: true
```

You can alternatively provide a file attribute instead of url pointing to a local plan file:

### dns

```YAML
yyy:
 type: dns
 net: default
 ip: 192.168.1.35
```

### workflow

Workflow allows you to launch scripts locally after they are rendered

```YAML
myworkflow:
  type: workflow
  scripts:
  - frout.sh
  - prout.py
  files:
  - frout.txt
```

This would execute the two scripts after rendering them into a temporary directory, along with the files if provided.
Note that you can omit the scripts section and instead indicate the script to run as name of the workflow. This requires it to be a sh/bash script and as such beeing suffixed by .sh

### vms
You can point at an existing profile in your plans, define all parameters for the vms, or combine both approaches. You can even add your own profile definitions in the plan file and reference them within the same plan:

```YAML
big:
  type: profile
  template: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
  memory: 6144
  numcpus: 1
  disks:
   - size: 45
  nets:
   - default
  pool: default

myvm:
  profile: big
```

Specific scripts and IPS arrays can be used directly in the plan file (or in profiles one).

The [kcli-plan-samples repo](https://github.com/karmab/kcli-plan-samples) contains samples to get you started. You will also find under karmab user dedicated plan repos to deploy ovirt, openstack, ...

When launching a plan, the plan name is optional. If none is provided, a random one will be used.

If no plan file is specified with the -f flag, the file `kcli_plan.yml` in the current directory will be used.

When deleting a plan, the network of the vms will also be deleted if no other vm are using them. You can prevent this by setting *keepnetworks* to `true` in your configuration.


## Remote plans

You can use the following command to execute a plan from a remote url:

```YAML
kcli create plan --url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karmab/kcli-plans/master/ovirt/upstream.yml
```

## Disk parameters

You can add disk this way in your profile or plan files:

```YAML
disks:
 - size: 20
   pool: vms
 - size: 10
   thin: False
   interface: ide
```

Within a disk section, you can use the word size, thin and format as keys.

- *thin* Value used when not specified in the disk entry. Defaults to true
- *interface* Value used when not specified in the disk entry. Defaults to virtio. Could also be ide, if vm lacks virtio drivers

## Network parameters

You can mix simple strings pointing to the name of your network and more complex information provided as hash. For instance:

```YAML
nets:
 - default
 - name: private
   nic: eth1
   ip: 192.168.0.220
   mask: 255.255.255.0
   gateway: 192.168.0.1
```

Within a net section, you can use name, nic, IP, mac, mask, gateway and alias as keys. type defaults to virtio but you can specify anyone (e1000,....).

You can also use  *noconf: true* to only add the nic with no configuration done in the vm.

the *ovs: true* allows you to create the nic as ovs port of the indicated bridge. Not that such bridges have to be created independently at the moment

You can provide network configuration on the command line when creating a single vm with *-P ip1=... -P netmask1=... -P gateway=...*

## ip, dns and host Reservations

If you set *reserveip*  to True, a reservation will be made if the corresponding network has dhcp and when the provided IP belongs to the network range.

You can set *reservedns* to True to create a dns entry for the vm in the corresponding network ( only done for the first nic).

You can set *reservehost* to True to create an entry for the host in /etc/hosts ( only done for the first nic). It's done with sudo and the entry gets removed when you delete the vm. On macosx, you should use gnu-sed ( from brew ) instead of regular sed for proper deletion.

If you dont want to be asked for your sudo password each time, here are the commands that are escalated:

```Shell
 - echo .... # KVIRT >> /etc/hosts
 - sed -i '/.... # KVIRT/d' /etc/hosts
```

## Docker/Podman support in plans

Docker/Podman support is mainly enabled as a commodity to launch some containers along vms in plan files. Of course, you will need docker or podman installed on the client. So the following can be used in a plan file to launch a container:

```YAML
centos:
 type: container
  image: centos
  cmd: /bin/bash
  ports:
   - 5500
  volumes:
   - /root/coco
```

The following keywords can be used:

- *image* name of the image to pull.
- *cmd* command to run within the container.
- *ports* array of ports to map between host and container.
- *volumes* array of volumes to map between host and container. You can alternatively use the keyword *disks*. You can also use more complex information provided as a hash

Within a volumes section, you can use path, origin, destination and mode as keys. mode can either be rw o ro and when origin or destination are missing, path is used and the same path is used for origin and destination of the volume. You can also use this typical docker syntax:

```YAML
volumes:
 - /home/cocorico:/root/cocorico
```

Additionally, basic commands ( start, stop, console, plan, list) accept a *--container* flag.

Also note that while python sdk is used when connecting locally, commands are rather proxied other ssh when using a remote hypervisor ( reasons beeing to prevent mismatch of version between local and remote docker and because enabling remote access for docker is considered insecure and needs some uncommon additional steps ).

Finally, note that if using the docker version of kcli against your local hypervisor , you'll need to pass a docker socket:

`docker run --rm -v /var/run/libvirt:/var/run/libvirt -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock karmab/kcli`

## Exposing a plan

### Basic functionality

You can expose through web a single plan with `kcli expose` so that others can make use of some infrastructure you own without having to deal with kcli themseleves.

The user will be presented with a simple UI with a listing of the current vms of the plan and buttons allowing to either delete the plan or reprovision it.

To expose your plan (with an optional list of parameters):

```
kcli expose plan -f your_plan.yml -P param1=value1 -P param2=value plan_name
```

The indicated parameters are the ones from the plan that you want to expose to the user upon provisioning, with their corresponding default value.

When the user reprovisions, In addition to those parameters, he will be able to specify:

- a list of mail addresses to notify upon completion of the lab provisioning. Note it requires to properly set notifications in your kcli config.
- an optional owner which will be added as metadata to the vms, so that it's easy to know who provisioned a given plan

### Precreating a list of plans

If you're running the same plan with different parameter files, you can simply create them in the directory where your plan lives, naming them parameters_XXX.yml (or .yaml). The UI will then show you those as separated plans so that they can be provisioned individually applying the corresponding values from the parameter files (after merging them with the user provided data).

### Using several clients

You can have the expose feature handling several clients at once.
For this, launch the expose command with the flag -C to indicate several clients ( for instance *-C twix,bumblefoot*) and put your parameter files under a dedicated directory matching the client name.
The code will then select the proper client for create/delete operations and report the vms belonging to those plans from the different clients declared.

### Using expose feature from a web server

You can use mod_wsgi with httpd or similar mechanisms to use the expose feature behind a web server so that you serve content from a specific port or add layer of security like htpasswd provided from outside the code.

For instance, you could create the following kcli.conf in apache

```
<VirtualHost *>
    WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/kcli.wsgi
    <Directory /var/www/kcli>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
#    <Location />
#	AuthType Basic
#	AuthName "Authentication Required"
#	AuthUserFile "/var/www/kcli.htpasswd"
#	Require valid-user
#    </Location>
</VirtualHost>
```

```
import logging
import os
import sys
from kvirt.config import Kconfig
from kvirt.expose import Kexposer
logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout)

os.environ['HOME'] = '/usr/share/httpd'
inputfile = '/var/www/myplans/plan1.yml'
overrides = {'param1': 'jimi_hendrix', 'param2': False}
config = Kconfig()
extraconfigs = {}
for extraclient in config.extraclients:
    extraconfigs[extraclient] = Kconfig(client=extraclient)
kexposer = Kexposer(config, 'myplan', inputfile, overrides=overrides, extraconfigs=extraconfigs)
application = kexposer.app
application.secret_key = ‘XXX’
```

Note that further configuration will tipically be needed for apache user so that kcli can be used with it

In the example invocation, the directive `config = KConfig()` can be changed to `config = Kconfig('client1,client2')` to handle several clients at once

An alternative is to create different WSGI applications and tweak the *WSGIScriptAlias* to serve them from different paths.

# Overriding parameters

You can override parameters in:

- commands
- scripts
- files
- plan files
- profiles

For that, you can pass in kcli vm or kcli plan the following parameters:

- -P x=1 -P y=2 and so on .
- --paramfile - In this case, you provide a yaml file ( and as such can provide more complex structures ).

The indicated objects are then rendered using jinja.

```
centos:
 template: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
 cmds:
  - echo x={{ x }} y={{ y }} >> /tmp/cocorico.txt
  - echo {{ password | default('unix1234') }} | passwd --stdin root
```

You can make the previous example cleaner by using the special key parameters in your plans and define there variables:

```
parameters:
 password: unix1234
 x: coucou
 y: toi
centos:
 template: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
 cmds:
  - echo x={{ x }} y={{ y }} >> /tmp/cocorico.txt
  - echo {{ password  }} | passwd --stdin root
```

Finally note that you can also use advanced jinja constructs like conditionals and so on. For instance:

```
parameters:
  net1: default
vm4:
  template: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
  nets:
    - {{ net1 }}
{% if net2 is defined %}
    - {{ net2 }}
{% endif %}
```

Also, you can reference a *baseplan* file in the *parameters* section, so that parameters are concatenated between the base plan file and the current one:

```
parameters:
   baseplan: upstream.yml
   xx_version: v0.7.0
```

# Ansible support

klist.py is provided as a dynamic inventory for ansible.

The script uses sames conf as kcli (and as such defaults to local if no configuration file is found).

vms will be grouped by plan, or put in the kvirt group if they dont belong to any plan.

Try it with:

```Shell
klist.py --list
KLIST=$(which klist.py)
ansible all -i $KLIST -m ping
```

If you're using kcli as a container, you will have to create a script such as the following to properly call the inventory.

```
#!/bin/bash
docker run -it --security-opt label:disable -v ~/.kcli:/root/.kcli -v /var/run/libvirt:/var/run/libvirt --entrypoint=/usr/bin/klist.py karmab/kcli $@
```

Additionally, there are ansible kcli modules in [ansible-kcli-modules](https://github.com/karmab/ansible-kcli-modules) repository, with sample playbooks:

- kvirt_vm allows you to create/delete vm (based on an existing profile or a template)
- kvirt_plan allows you to create/delete a plan
- kvirt_product allows you to create/delete a product (provided you have a product repository configured)
- kvirt_info allows you to retrieve a dict of values similar to `kcli info` output. You can select which fields to gather

Those modules rely on python3 so you will need to pass `-e 'ansible_python_interpreter=path_to_python3'` to your ansible-playbook invocations ( or set it in your inventory) if your default ansible installation is based on python2.

Both kvirt_vm, kvirt_plan and kvirt_product support overriding parameters:

```
- name: Deploy fission with additional parameters
  kvirt_product:
    name: fission
    product: fission
    parameters:
     fission_type: all
     docker_disk_size: 10
```

Finally, you can use the key ansible within a profile:

```YAML
ansible:
 - playbook: frout.yml
   verbose: true
   variables:
    - x: 8
    - z: 12
```

In a plan file, you can also define additional sections with the ansible type and point to your playbook, optionally enabling verbose and using the key hosts to specify a list of vms to run the given playbook instead.

You wont define variables in this case, as you can leverage host_vars and groups_vars directory for this purpose.

```YAML
myplay:
 type: ansible
 verbose: false
 playbook: prout.yml
```

When leveraging ansible this way, an inventory file will be generated on the fly for you and let in */tmp/$PLAN.inv*.

You can set the variable yamlinventory to True at default, host or profile level if you want the generated file to be yaml based. In this case, it will be named */tmp/$PLAN.inv.yaml*.

# Using products

To easily share plans, you can make use of the products feature which leverages them:

## Repos

First, add a repo containing a KMETA file with yaml info about products you want to expose. For instance, mine

```
kcli create repo -u https://github.com/karmab/kcli-plans karmab
```

You can also update later a given repo, to refresh its KMETA file ( or all the repos, if not specifying any)

```
kcli update repo REPO_NAME
```

You can delete a given repo with

```
kcli delete repo REPO_NAME
```

## Product

Once you have added some repos, you can list available products, and get their description

```
kcli list products 
```

You can also get direct information on the product (memory and cpu used, number of vms deployed and all parameters that can be overriden)

```
kcli info product YOUR_PRODUCT 
```

And deploy any product. Deletion is handled by deleting the corresponding plan.

```
kcli create product YOUR_PRODUCT
```

# Deploying kubernetes/openshift clusters (and applications on top!)

You can deploy generic kubernetes (based on kubeadm), k3s or openshift/okd on any platform and on an arbitrary number of masters and workers.
The cluster can be scaled aferwards too.

## Getting information on available parameters

For each supported platform, you can use `kcli info kube`

For instance, `kcli info kube generic` will provide you all the parameters available for customization for generic kubernetes clusters.

## Deploying generic kubernetes clusters

```
kcli create kube generic -P masters=X -P workers=Y $cluster
```

## Deploying openshift/okd clusters

*DISCLAIMER*: This is not supported in anyway by Red Hat (although the end result cluster would be).

for Openshift, the official installer is leveraged with kcli creating the vms instead of Terraform, and injecting some extra pods to provide a vip and self contained dns.

The main benefits of deploying Openshift with kcli are:

- Auto download openshift-install binary specified version.
- Easy vms tuning.
- Single workflow regardless of the target platform
- Self contained dns. (For cloud platforms, cloud public dns is leveraged instead)
- For libvirt, no need to compile installer or tweak libvirtd.
- Vms can be connected to a physical bridge.
- Multiple clusters can live on the same l2 network.
- Support for disconnected registry and ipv6 networks

### Requirements

- Valid pull secret (for downstream)
- Ssh public key.
- Write access to /etc/hosts file to allow editing of this file.
- An available ip in your vm's network to use as *api_ip*. Make sure it is excluded from your dhcp server. An optional *ingress_ip* can be specified, otherwise api_ip will be used.
- Direct access to the deployed vms. Use something like this otherwise `sshuttle -r your_hypervisor 192.168.122.0/24 -v`).
- Target platform needs:
  - Ignition support 
     - (for Ovirt/Rhv, this means >= 4.4).
     - For Libvirt, support for fw_cfg in qemu (install qemu-kvm-ev on centos for instance).
  - On Openstack:
     - swift available on the install.
     - a flavor. You can create a dedicated one with `openstack flavor create --id 6 --ram 32768 --vcpus 16 --disk 30 m1.openshift`
     - a port on target network mapped to a floating ip. If not specified with api_ip and public_api_ip parameters, the second-to-last ip from the network will be used.
- For ipv6, you need to run the following sysctl `net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra=2`

### How to Use

#### Create a parameters.yml

Prepare a parameter file with valid variables:

A minimal one could be the following one

```
cluster: mycluster
domain: karmalabs.com
version: stable
tag: '4.8'
masters: 3 
workers:2
memory: 16384
numcpus: 16
```

Here's the list of all variables that can be used (you can list them with `kcli info cluster openshift`)

|Parameter                 |Default Value                                |Comments|
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------|
|*version*|nightly|You can choose between nightly, ci or stable. ci requires specific data in your secret|
|tag                   |4.5                               ||
|async                 |false                             |Exit once vms are created and let job in cluster delete bootstrap|
|notify                |false                             |Whether to send notifications once cluster is deployed. Mean to be used in async mode|
|pull_secret           |openshift_pull.json               ||
|image                 |rhcos45                           |rhcos image to use (should be qemu for libvirt/kubevirt and openstack one for ovirt/openstack)|

#### Deploying

```
kcli create kube openshift --paramfile parameters.yml $cluster
```

- You will be asked for your sudo password in order to create a /etc/hosts entry for the api vip.

- Once that finishes, set the following environment variable in order to use oc commands `export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kcli/clusters/$cluster/auth/kubeconfig`

### Providing custom machine configs

If a `manifests` directory exists in the current directory, the *yaml assets found there are copied to the directory generated by the install, prior to deployment.

### Architecture

Check [This documentation](https://github.com/karmab/kcli/blob/master/docs/openshift_architecture.md)

### SNO (single node openshift ) support

You can deploy a single node setting masters to 1 and workers to 0 in your parameter file. On Cloud platforms, you can use an extra parameter, `sno_cloud_remove_lb`, to remove loadbalancer and point dns directly to the public ip of your node, making the resulting cluster only rely on the corresponding instance.

Alternatively, you can leverage bootstrap in place (bip) and rhcos live iso with the flag `sno`, which allows you to provision a baremetal sno by creating a custom iso stored in your specified libvirt pool.
The following extra parameters are available with this workflow:

- sno_disk: You can indicate which disk to use for installing Rhcos operating system in your node. If none is specified, the disk will be autodiscovered
- sno_dns: Defaults to true. A static pod leveraging coredns and pointing the relevant dns records to the ip of the node is injected after master ignition is generated, removing the need for external dns. Use this if you can't provide the DNS requirements for the single node
- sno_virtual: Defaults to false. If you set it to true, a vm leveraging the generated iso will be created and install will be monitored up until the end. This is mostly available for dog fooding the bip approach.
- extra_args: You can use this variable to specify as a string any extra args to add to the generated iso. A common use case for this is to set static networking for the node, for instanc with something like `ip=192.168.1.200::192.168.1.1:255.255.255.0:mysupersno.dev.local:enp1s0:none nameserver=192.168.1.1`
- api_ip: This is normally not needed but if you already have some DNS records in place pointing to a given api vip or you don't know your baremetal ip, you can specify the vip so that an extra keepalived static pod is injected.

Note that in the baremetal context, you are responsible for attaching the generated iso to your target node.

### Adding more workers

The procedure is the same independently of the type of cluster used.

```
kcli scale kube <generic|openshift|okd|k3s> -w num_of_workers --paramfile parameters.yml $cluster
```

In openshift case, for baremetal workers you can use the following command:

```
kcli create openshift-iso --paramfile parameters.yml $cluster
```

### Interacting with your clusters

All generated assets for a given cluster are stored in `$HOME/.kcli/clusters/$cluster`.

In particular, the kubeconfig file to use to interact with the cluster is stored at `$HOME/.kcli/clusters/$cluster/auth/kubeconfig`

### Cleaning up

The procedure is the same independently of the type of cluster used.

```
kcli delete kube $cluster
```

# Deploying applications on top of kubernetes/openshift

You can use kcli to deploy applications on your kubernetes/openshift (regardless of whether it was deployed with kcli)

Applications such as the following one are currently supported:

- argocd
- kubevirt
- rook
- istio
- knative
- tekton

To list applications available on generic kubernetes, run:

```
kcli list kube generic
```

To list applications available on generic openshift, run:

```
kcli list kube openshift
```

For any of the supported applications, you can get information on the supported parameters with:

```
kcli info app generic|openshift $app_name
```

To deploy an app, use the following, with additional parameters passed in the command line or in a parameter file:

```
kcli create app generic|openshift $app_name
```

Applications can be deleted the same way:

```
kcli delete app generic|openshift $app_name
```

# Running on kubernetes/openshift 

You can run the container on those platforms and either use the web interface or log in the pod to run `kcli` commandline

On openshift, you'll need to run first those extra commands:

```
oc new-project kcli
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:kcli:default
oc expose svc kcli
```

Then:

```
kubectl create configmap kcli-config --from-file=~/.kcli
kubectl create configmap ssh-config --from-file=~/.ssh
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karmab/kcli/master/extras/k8sdeploy.yml
```

Alternatively, look at [https://github.com/karmab/kcli-controller](https://github.com/karmab/kcli-controller) for a controller/operator handling vms and plans as crds and creating the corresponding assets with kcli/kvirt library.

# Using Jenkins

## Requisites

- Jenkins running somewhere, either:
   - standalone
   - on K8s/Openshift
- Docker running if using this backend
- Podman installed if using this backend

## Credentials

First, create the following credentials in Jenkins as secret files:

- kcli-config with the content of your ~/.kcli/config.yml
- kcli-id-rsa with your ssh private key
- kcli-id-rsa-pub with your ssh public key

You can use arbitrary names for those credentials, but you will then have to either edit Jenkinsfile later or specify credentials when running your build.

## Kcli configuration

Default backend is *podman* . If you want to use Docker or Kubernetes instead, add the corresponding snippet in *~/.kcli/config.yml*.

For instance, for Kubernetes:

```
jenkinsmode: kubernetes
```

## Create Jenkins file

Now you can create a Jenkinsfile from your specific, or from default *kcli_plan.yml*

```
kcli create pipeline
```

You can see an example of the generated Jenkinsfile for both targets from the sample plan provided in this directory.

Parameters from the plan get converted in Jenkins parameters, along with extra parameters:
- for needed credentials (kcli config file, public and private ssh key)
- a `wait` boolean to indicated whether to wait for plan completion upon run.
- a `kcli_client` parameter that can be used to override the target client where to launch plan at run time.

Your Jenkinsfile is ready for use!

## Openshift

You can create credentials as secrets and tag them so they get synced to Jenkins:

```
oc create secret generic kcli-config-yml --from-file=filename=config.yml
oc annotate secret/kcli-config-yml jenkins.openshift.io/secret.name=kcli-config-yml
oc label secret/kcli-config-yml credential.sync.jenkins.openshift.io=true

oc create secret generic kcli-id-rsa --from-file=filename=~/.ssh/id_rsa
oc annotate secret/kcli-id-rsa jenkins.openshift.io/secret.name=kcli-id-rsa
oc label secret/kcli-id-rsa credential.sync.jenkins.openshift.io=true

oc create secret generic kcli-id-rsa-pub --from-file=filename=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
oc annotate secret/kcli-id-rsa-pub jenkins.openshift.io/secret.name=kcli-id-rsa-pub
oc label secret/kcli-id-rsa-pub credential.sync.jenkins.openshift.io=true
```

You will also need to allow *anyuid* scc for kcli pod, which can be done with the following command (adjust to your project):

```
PROJECT=kcli
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:$PROJECT:default
```

# Auto Completion

You can enable autocompletion if running kcli from package or pip. It's enabled by default when running kclishell container alias

## Bash/Zsh

Add the following line in one of your shell files (.bashrc, .zshrc, ...)

```
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete kcli)"
```

## Fish

Add the following snippet in *.config/fish/config.fish*
```
function __fish_kcli_complete
    set -x _ARGCOMPLETE 1
    set -x _ARGCOMPLETE_IFS \n
    set -x _ARGCOMPLETE_SUPPRESS_SPACE 1
    set -x _ARGCOMPLETE_SHELL fish
    set -x COMP_LINE (commandline -p)
    set -x COMP_POINT (string length (commandline -cp))
    set -x COMP_TYPE
    if set -q _ARC_DEBUG
        kcli 8>&1 9>&2 1>/dev/null 2>&1
    else
        kcli 8>&1 9>&2 1>&9 2>&1
    end
end
complete -c kcli -f -a '(__fish_kcli_complete)'
```

# Api Usage

## Locally

You can also use kvirt library directly, without the client or to embed it into your own application.

Here's a sample:

```
from kvirt.config import Kconfig
config = Kconfig()
k = config.k
```

You can then either use config for high level actions or the more low level *k* object.

## Using grpc

### Server side

Kcli provides an api using grpc protocol. This allows to run one or several instances of kcli as proxies and use
a lightweight client written in the language of your choice.

To make use of it:

- On a node with kcli installed, launch `krpc`. If installing from rpm, you will need python3-grpcio package which:
   - comes out of the box on fedora
   - is available through [RDO repo](https://trunk.rdoproject.org/rhel8-master/deps/latest) for centos8/rhel8
- On the client side, you can then access the api by targetting port 50051 of the server node (in insecure mode)

Note that the server doesn't implement all the features yet. Most notably, *create_plan* isn't available at the moment. Check the following [doc](https://github.com/karmab/kcli/blob/master/docs/grpc_methods.md) to see the status of the implementation.

### Client side

- You can use a GRPC client such grpcurl. To list services, you need krpc to have grpcio-reflection package, which is only available through pip (and is installed when running kcli as container). You can use `grpcurl -plaintext $KCLI_SERVER:50051 list` to see objects at your disposal.
- `kclirpc` can be used as a cli mimicking kcli but with grpc calls.
- There is also a terraform provider for kcli using GRPC you can get from [here](https://github.com/karmab/terraform-provider-kcli)
