About
=====

This tool is meant to interact with existing virtualization providers
(libvirt, kubevirt, ovirt, openstack, gcp and aws) and to easily deploy
and customize vms from cloud images.

You can also interact with those vms (list, info, ssh, start, stop,
delete, console, serialconsole, add/delete disk, add/delete nic,…)

Futhermore, you can deploy vms using predefined profiles, several at
once using plan files or entire products for which plans were already
created for you

Installation
============

Requisites
----------

If you dont have kvm installed on the target hypervisor, you can also
use the following command to get you going

.. code:: bash

    yum -y install libvirt libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu qemu-kvm 
    sudo usermod -aG qemu,libvirt YOUR_USER
    newgrp libvirt

For interaction with local docker daemon, you also need the following

.. code:: bash

    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker YOUR_USER
    sudo systemctl restart docker

For ubuntu, you will need the following hack:

.. code:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages

If not running as root, you’ll have to add your user to those groups

.. code:: bash

    sudo usermod -aG qemu,libvirt YOUR_USER

for *macosx*, you’ll want to check the docker installation section ( if
planning to go against a remote kvm hypervisor)

RPM install method
------------------

If using *fedora*, you can use this:

.. code:: bash

    dnf -y copr enable karmab/kcli ; dnf -y install kcli

If using a debian based distribution, you can use this( example is for
ubuntu zesty):

.. code:: bash

    echo deb [trusted=yes] https://packagecloud.io/karmab/kcli/ubuntu/ zesty main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kcli.list ; apt-get update ; apt-get -y install kcli-all

Container install method
------------------------

Pull the latest image:

.. code:: shell

    docker pull karmab/kcli

To run it

.. code:: shell

    docker run --rm karmab/kcli

the are several flags you’ll want to pass depending on your use case

-  ``-v /var/run/libvirt:/var/run/libvirt -v /var/lib/libvirt/images:/var/lib/libvirt/images``
   if running against a local client
-  ``~/.kcli:/root/.kcli`` to use your kcli configuration (also profiles
   and repositories) stored locally
-  ``-v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh`` to share your ssh keys. Alternatively, you
   can store your public and private key in the ~/.kcli directory
-  ``--security-opt label:disable`` if running with selinux
-  ``-v $PWD:/workdir`` to access plans below your current directory
-  ``-v $HOME:/root`` to share your entire home directory, useful if you
   want to share secret files, ``~/register.sh`` for instance)
-  ``-e HTTP_PROXY=your_proxy -e HTTPS_PROXY=your_proxy``
-  ``-v ~/.kube:/root/.kube`` to share your kubeconfig.

As a bonus, you can alias kcli and run it as if it was installed
locally:

.. code:: shell

    alias kcli='docker run -it --rm --net=host --security-opt label:disable -v ~/.kcli:/root/.kcli -v /var/lib/libvirt/images:/var/lib/libvirt/images -v /var/run/libvirt:/var/run/libvirt -v $PWD:/workdir karmab/kcli'

For web access, you can switch with
``-p 9000:9000 --entrypoint=/usr/bin/kweb`` and thus accessing to port
9000

I don’t want a big fat daemon
-----------------------------

Use podman! Remember to store your public and private key in the ~/.kcli
directory so you dont need to share your entire .ssh directory as a
volume (kcli container is based on alpine, and as such uses a ssh client
which doesnt support gssapi)

::

    alias kcli='podman run -it --rm --net=host --security-opt label=disable -v ~/.kcli:/root/.kcli -v /var/lib/libvirt/images:/var/lib/libvirt/images -v /var/run/libvirt:/var/run/libvirt -v $PWD:/workdir karmab/kcli'

Dev installation from pip
-------------------------

Generic platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install kcli from pypi

.. code:: shell

    pip install kcli

Or for a full install using latest

::

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/karmab/kcli.git#egg=kcli[all]

CentOS installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the provided
`script <https://github.com/karmab/kcli/blob/master/extras/centos.sh>`__
which will install a dedicated python3 env

Configuration
=============

If you only want to use your local libvirt, *no specific configuration*
is needed. On most distributions, default network and storage pool
already exist.

You can add an additional storage pool with:

.. code:: shell

    kcli pool  -p /var/lib/libvirt/images default

You can also create a default network

.. code:: shell

    kcli network  -c 192.168.122.0/24 default

kcli configuration is done in ~/.kcli directory that you need to
manually create. It will contain:

-  config.yml generic configuration where you declare clients
-  profiles.yml stores your profiles where you combine things like
   memory, numcpus and all supported parameters into named profiles to
   create vms from
-  id_rsa/id_rsa.pub/id_dsa/id_dsa.pub You can also choose to store your
   default public and private keys in *kcli* directory which will be the
   first place to look at them when connecting to a remote kvm
   hpervisor, virtual machine or when injecting your public key. This is
   useful when using kcli container and not wanting to share your entire
   ~/.ssh directory in your container

For instance, here ’s a sample ``~/.kcli/config.yml``

.. code:: yaml

    default:
     client: mycli
     numcpus: 2
     diskthin: true
     memory: 512
     disks:
      - size: 10
     protocol: ssh
     cloudinit: true
     reserveip: false
     nets:
      - default

    mycli:
     host: 192.168.0.6
     pool: default

    bumblefoot:
     host: 192.168.0.4
     pool: whatever

Replace with your own client in default section and indicate host and
protocol in the corresponding client section.

Most of the parameters are actually optional, and can be overridden in
the default, client or profile section (or in a plan file). You can find
a fully detailed config.yml sample
`here <https://github.com/karmab/kcli/tree/master/samples/config.yml>`__

Alternatively, you can generate this settings file ( for tweaking or to
add remote hypervisors):

.. code:: shell

    kcli bootstrap

And for advanced bootstrapping, you can specify a target name, host, a
pool with a path, and have centos cloud image downloaded

.. code:: shell

    kcli bootstrap -n twix -H 192.168.0.6 --pool vms --poolpath /home/vms

Provider specifics
==================

Libvirt
-------

::

    twix:
     type: kvm
     host: 192.168.1.6

Without configuration, libvirt provider tries to connect locally using
qemu:///system

Additionally, remote libvirt hypervisors can be configured by indicating
either a host, a port and protocol or a custom qemu uri.

When using the host, port and protocol combination, default protocol
uses ssh and as such assumes you are able to connect without password to
your remote libvirt instance by mean of your public/private ssh key.

If using tcp protocol instead, you will need to configure libvirtd in
your remote libvirt hypervisor to accept insecure remote connections

You will also likely want to indicate default libvirt pool to use
(although as with most parameters, it can be done in the default
section)

The following parameters are specific to libvirt:

-  url custom qemu uri
-  session Defaults to False. If you want to use qemu:///session (
   locally or remotely). Not recommended as it complicates access to the
   vm and is supposed to have lower performance

Gcp
---

::

    gcp1:
     type: gcp
     credentials: ~/myproject.json
     project: myproject
     zone: europe-west1-b

The following parameters are specific to gcp:

-  credentials (pointing to a json service account file). if not
   specified, the environment variable *GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS*
   will be used
-  project
-  zone

also note that gcp provider supports creation of dns records for an
existing domain and that your home public key will be uploaded if needed

To gather your service account file:

-  Select the “IAM” → “Service accounts” section within the Google Cloud
   Platform console.
-  Select “Create Service account”.
-  Select “Project” → “Editor” as service account Role.
-  Select “Furnish a new private key”.
-  Select “Save”

to Create a dns zone

-  Select the “Networking” → “Network Services” → “Cloud DNS”
-  Select “Create Zone”
-  Put the same name as your domain, but with ‘-’ instead

If accessing behind a proxy, be sure to set *HTTPS_PROXY* environment
variable to ``http://your_proxy:your_port``

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you’ll need to install (from pip)

-  *google-api-python-client*
-  *google-auth-httplib2*
-  *google-cloud-dns*

Aws
---

::

    aws:
     type: aws
     access_key_id: AKAAAAAAAAAAAAA
     access_key_secret: xxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyy
     region: eu-west-3
     keypair: mykey

The following parameters are specific to aws:

-  access_key_id
-  access_key_secret
-  region
-  keypair

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you’ll need to install
*python3-boto3* rpm

Kubevirt
--------

for kubevirt, you will need to define one ( or several !) sections with
the type kubevirt in your *~/.kcli/config.yml*

authentication is either handled by your local ~/.kubeconfig (kcli will
try to connect to your current kubernetes/openshift context or with
specific token

::

    kubevirt:
     type: kubevirt

You can use additional parameters for the kubevirt section:

-  context: the k8s context to use
-  pool: your default storageclass. can also be set as blank, if no
   storage class should try to bind pvcs
-  host: k8s api node .Also used for tunneling ssh (and consoles)
-  port: k8s api port
-  ca_file: optional certificate path
-  token: token, either from user or service account.
-  tags: additional tags to put to all created vms in their
   *nodeSelector*. Can be further indicated at profile or plan level in
   which case values are combined. This provides an easy way to force
   vms to run on specific nodes, by matching labels.
-  multus: whether to create vms on multus backed networks. Defaults to
   true
-  cdi: whether to use cdi. Defaults to true. A check on whether cdi is
   actually present will be performed

You can use the following indications to gather context, create a
suitable service account and retrieve its associated token

To list the context at your disposal

::

    kubectl config view -o jsonpath='{.contexts[*].name}'

To create a service account and give it privileges to handle vms,

::

    SERVICEACCOUNT=xxx
    kubectl create serviceaccount $SERVICEACCOUNT
    kubectl create clusterrolebinding $SERVICEACCOUNT --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=system:serviceaccount:default:$SERVICEACCOUNT

To gather a token ( in /tmp/token)

::

    SERVICEACCOUNT=xxx
    SECRET=`kubectl get sa $SERVICEACCOUNT -o jsonpath={.secrets[0].name}`
    kubectl get secret $SECRET -o jsonpath={.data.token} | base64 -d

on openshift, you can simply use

::

    oc whoami -t

*virtctl* is a hard requirement for consoles. If present on your local
machine, this will be used. otherwise, it s expected that the host node
has it installed.

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you’ll need to install
*python3-kubernetes* rpm

Ovirt
-----

::

    myovirt:
     type: ovirt
     host: ovirt.default
     user: admin@internal
     password: prout
     datacenter: Default
     cluster: Default
     pool: Default
     org: YourOrg
     ca_file: ~/ovirt.pem
     imagerepository: ovirt-image-repository

The following parameters are specific to ovirt:

-  org Organization
-  ca_file Points to a local path with the cert of the ovirt engine
   host. It can be retrieved with
   ``wget http://$HOST/ovirt-engine/services/pki-resource?resource=ca-certificate&format=X509-PEM-CA``
-  imagerepository. A Glance image provider repository. Defaults to
   ``ovirt-image-repository``.
-  cluster Defaults to Default
-  datacenter Defaults to Default
-  filtervms Defaults to True. Only list vms created by kcli. Useful for
   environments when you are superadmin and have a ton of vms
-  filteruser Defaults to False. Only list vms created by own user
-  filtertag Defaults to None. Only list vms created by kcli with the
   corresponding filter=filtertag in their description. Useful for
   environments when you share the same user

Note that pool refers to storage domain

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you’ll need to install (from pip)
*ovirt-engine-sdk-python*

On fedora, for instance, you can run the following

::

    dnf -y copr enable karmab/kcli
    yum -y install kcli gcc redhat-rpm-config python3-devel openssl-devel libxml2-devel libcurl-devel
    export PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=openssl
    pip3 install ovirt-engine-sdk-python

Openstack
---------

::

    myopenstack:
     type: openstack
     user: testk
     password: testk
     project: testk
     domain: Default
     auth_url: http://openstack:5000/v3

The following parameters are specific to openstack:

-  auth_url
-  project
-  domain

To use this provider with kcli rpm, you’ll need to install the following
rpms

-  *python3-keystoneclient*
-  *python3-glanceclient*
-  *python3-cinderclient*
-  *python3-neutronclient*
-  *python3-novaclient*

Fake
----

you can also use a fake provider to get a feel of how kcli works (or to
generate the cloudinit scripts)

::

    fake:
     type: fake

Usage
=====

Templates aim to typically be the source for your vms, using the
existing cloud images from the different distributions. *kcli download*
can be used to download a specific cloud image. for instance, centos7:

.. code:: shell

    kcli download centos7

at this point, you can deploy vms directly from the template, using
default settings for the vm:

.. code:: shell

    kcli vm -p CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2 vm1

by default, your public key will be injected (using cloudinit) to the vm

you can then access the vm using *kcli ssh*

kcli uses the default ssh_user according to the different `cloud
images <http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html>`__. To
guess it, kcli checks the template name. So for example, your centos
image must contain the term “centos” in the file name, otherwise the
default user “root” will be used.

Using parameters, you can tweak the vm creation. All keywords can be
used. For instance

.. code:: shell

    kcli vm -p CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2 -P memory=2048 -P numcpus=2 vm1

You can also pass disks, networks, cmds (or any keyword)

.. code:: shell

    kcli vm -p CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2 -P disks=[10,20] -P nets=[default,default] -P cmds=[yum -y install nc] vm1

Instead of passing parameters this way, you can use profiles.

Profiles configuration
----------------------

Profiles are meant to help creating single vm with preconfigured
settings (number of CPUS, memory, size of disk, network, whether to use
a template, extra commands to run on start, whether reserving dns,….)

You use the file *~/.kcli/profiles.yml* to declare your profiles. Here’s
a snippet declaring the profile ``centos``

::

    centos:
     template: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
     numcpus: 2
     disks:
      - size: 10
     reservedns: true
     nets:
      - name: default
     cmds:
      - echo unix1234 | passwd --stdin root

With this section, you can use the following to create a vm

.. code:: shell

    kcli vm -p centos myvm

You can use the `profile file
sample <https://github.com/karmab/kcli/tree/master/samples/profiles.yml>`__
to get you started

Cloudinit stuff
---------------

cloudinit is enabled by default and handles static networking
configuration, hostname setting, injecting ssh keys and running specific
commands and entire scripts, and copying entire files.

For kvm vms based on coreos, ignition is used instead of cloudinit
although the syntax is the same.

A similar mechanism allows customization for other providers.

Typical commands
----------------

-  List vms

   -  ``kcli list``

-  List templates (it will find them out based on their qcow2
   extension…)

   -  ``kcli list -t``

-  Create vm from profile base7

   -  ``kcli vm -p base7 myvm``

-  Create vm from profile base7 for the specific client twix

   -  ``kcli -C twix vm -p base7 myvm``

-  Delete vm

   -  ``kcli delete vm1``

-  Get detailed info on a specific vm

   -  ``kcli info vm1``

-  Start vm

   -  ``kcli start vm1``

-  Stop vm

   -  ``kcli stop vm1``

-  Switch active client to bumblefoot

   -  ``kcli switch bumblefoot``

-  Get remote-viewer console

   -  ``kcli console vm1``

-  Get serial console (over TCP). It will only work with vms created
   with kcli and will require netcat client to be installed on
   hypervisor

   -  ``kcli console -s vm1``

-  Deploy multiple vms using plan x defined in x.yml file

   -  ``kcli plan -f x.yml x``

-  Delete all vm from plan x

   -  ``kcli plan -d x``

-  Add 5GB disk to vm1, using pool named images

   -  ``kcli disk -s 5 -p images vm1``

-  Delete disk named vm1_2.img from vm1

   -  ``kcli disk -d -n vm1_2.img  vm1``

-  Update to 2GB memory vm1

   -  ``kcli update -m 2048 vm1``

-  Clone vm1 to new vm2

   -  ``kcli clone -b vm1 vm2``

-  Connect by ssh to the vm

   -  ``kcli ssh vm1``

-  Add a new network

   -  ``kcli network -c 192.168.7.0/24 --dhcp mynet``

-  Add a new pool

   -  ``kcli pool -t dir -p /hom/images images``

-  Add a new nic from network default

   -  ``kcli nic -n default myvm``

-  Delete nic eth2 from vm

   -  ``kcli nic -di eth2 myvm``

-  Create snapshot snap of vm:

   -  ``kcli snapshot -n vm1 snap1``

-  Get info on your kvm setup

   -  ``kcli report``

-  Export vm:

   -  ``kcli export vm1``

How to use the web version
--------------------------

Launch the following command and access your machine at port 9000:

.. code:: shell

    kweb

Multiple clients
----------------

If you have multiple hypervisors/clients, you can generally use the flag
*-C $CLIENT* to point to a specific one.

You can also use the following to list all you vms :

``kcli -C all list``

Using plans
-----------

You can also define plan files in yaml with a list of profiles, vms,
disks, and networks and vms to deploy (look at the sample) and deploy it
with kcli plan. The following type can be used within a plan:

-  network
-  template
-  disk
-  pool
-  profile
-  ansible
-  container
-  dns
-  plan ( so you can compose plans from several urls)
-  vm ( this is the type used when none is specified )

Here are some examples of each type ( additional ones can be found in
this `samples
directory <https://github.com/karmab/kcli-plans/tree/master/samples>`__
):

network
~~~~~~~

.. code:: yaml

    mynet:
     type: network
     cidr: 192.168.95.0/24

You can also use the boolean keyword *dhcp* (mostly to disable it) and
isolated . When not specified, dhcp and nat will be enabled

template
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: yaml

    CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2:
     type: template
     url: http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2

It will only be downloaded only if not present

If you point to an url not ending in qcow2/qc2 ( or img), your browser
will be opened for you to proceed. Also note that you can specify a
command with the *cmd* key, so that virt-customize is used on the
template once it’s downloaded

disk
~~~~

.. code:: yaml

    share1.img:
     type: disk
     size: 5
     pool: vms
     vms:
      - centos1
      - centos2

Here the disk is shared between two vms (that typically would be defined
within the same plan):

pool
~~~~

.. code:: yaml

    mypool:
      type: pool
      path: /home/mypool

profile
~~~~~~~

.. code:: yaml

    myprofile:
      type: profile
      template: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
      memory: 3072
      numcpus: 1
      disks:
       - size: 15
       - size: 12
      nets:
       - default
      pool: default

ansible
~~~~~~~

.. code:: yaml

    myplay:
     type: ansible
     verbose: false
     playbook: prout.yml
     groups:
       nodes:
       - node1
       - node2
       masters:
       - master1
       - master2
       - master3

An inventory will be created for you in /tmp and that *group_vars* and
*host_vars* directory are taken into account. You can optionally define
your own groups, as in this example The playbooks are launched in
alphabetical order

container
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: yaml

    centos:
     type: container
      image: centos
      cmd: /bin/bash
      ports:
       - 5500
      volumes:
       - /root/coco

Look at the docker section for details on the parameters

plan’s plan ( Also known as inception style)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: yaml

    ovirt:
      type: plan
      url: github.com/karmab/kcli-plans/ovirt/upstream.yml
      run: true

You can alternatively provide a file attribute instead of url pointing
to a local plan file

dns
~~~

.. code:: yaml

    yyy:
     type: dns
     net: default
     ip: 192.168.1.35

vms
~~~

You can point at an existing profile in your plans, define all
parameters for the vms, or combine both approaches. You can even add
your own profile definitions in the plan file and reference them within
the same plan:

.. code:: yaml

    big:
      type: profile
      template: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
      memory: 6144
      numcpus: 1
      disks:
       - size: 45
      nets:
       - default
      pool: default

    myvm:
      profile: big

Specific scripts and IPS arrays can be used directly in the plan file
(or in profiles one).

The `kcli-plans repo <https://github.com/karmab/kcli-plans>`__ contains
samples to get you started, along with plans for projects i often use
(openshift, kubevirt,openstack, ovirt, …) .

The description of the vm will automatically be set to the plan name,
and this value will be used when deleting the entire plan as a way to
locate matching vms.

When launching a plan, the plan name is optional. If not is provided, a
random generated keyword will be used.

If a file with the plan isn’t specified with -f , the file kcli_plan.yml
in the current directory will be used, if available.

When deleting a plan, the network of the vms will also be deleted if no
other vm are using them. You can prevent this by using the keep (-k)
flag.

For an advanced use of plans along with scripts, check the
`plans <plans/README.md>`__ page to deploy all upstream projects
associated with Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure products (or downstream
versions too).

Remote plans
------------

You can use the following to execute a plan from a remote url :

.. code:: yaml

    kcli plan --url https://github.com/karmab/kcli-plans/blob/master/ovirt/upstream.yml

Disk parameters
---------------

You can add disk this way in your profile or plan files

.. code:: yaml

    disks:
     - size: 20
       pool: vms
     - size: 10
       thin: False
       interface: ide

Within a disk section, you can use the word size, thin and format as
keys

-  *thin* Value used when not specified in the disk entry. Defaults to
   true
-  *interface* Value used when not specified in the disk entry. Defaults
   to virtio. Could also be ide, if vm lacks virtio drivers

Network parameters
------------------

You can mix simple strings pointing to the name of your network and more
complex information provided as hash. For instance:

.. code:: yaml

    nets:
     - default
     - name: private
       nic: eth1
       ip: 192.168.0.220
       mask: 255.255.255.0
       gateway: 192.168.0.1

Within a net section, you can use name, nic, IP, mac, mask, gateway and
alias as keys. type defaults to virtio but you can specify anyone
(e1000,….)

You can also use *noconf: true* to only add the nic with no
configuration done in the vm

Fore coreos based vms, You can also use *etcd: true* to auto configure
etcd on the corresponding nic

the *ovs: true* allows you to create the nic as ovs port of the
indicated bridge. Not that such bridges have to be created independently
at the moment

You can provide network configuration on the command line when creating
a single vm with *-P ip1=… -P netmask1=… -P gateway=…*

ip, dns and host Reservations
-----------------------------

If you set *reserveip* to True, a reservation will be made if the
corresponding network has dhcp and when the provided IP belongs to the
network range.

You can set *reservedns* to True to create a dns entry for the vm in the
corresponding network ( only done for the first nic)

You can set *reservehost* to True to create an entry for the host in
/etc/hosts ( only done for the first nic). It’s done with sudo and the
entry gets removed when you delete the vm. On macosx, you should use
gnu-sed ( from brew ) instead of regular sed for proper deletion.

If you dont want to be asked for your sudo password each time, here are
the commands that are escalated:

.. code:: shell

     - echo .... # KVIRT >> /etc/hosts
     - sed -i '/.... # KVIRT/d' /etc/hosts

Docker support
--------------

Docker support is mainly enabled as a commodity to launch some
containers along vms in plan files. Of course, you will need docker
installed on the client. So the following can be used in a plan file to
launch a container:

.. code:: yaml

    centos:
     type: container
      image: centos
      cmd: /bin/bash
      ports:
       - 5500
      volumes:
       - /root/coco

The following keywords can be used:

-  *image* name of the image to pull ( You can alternatively use the
   keyword *template*
-  *cmd* command to run within the container
-  *ports* array of ports to map between host and container
-  *volumes* array of volumes to map between host and container. You can
   alternatively use the keyword *disks*. You can also use more complex
   information provided as a hash

Within a volumes section, you can use path, origin, destination and mode
as keys. mode can either be rw o ro and when origin or destination are
missing, path is used and the same path is used for origin and
destination of the volume. You can also use this typical docker syntax:

.. code:: yaml

    volumes:
     - /home/cocorico:/root/cocorico

Additionally, basic commands ( start, stop, console, plan, list) accept
a *–container* flag.

Also note that while python sdk is used when connecting locally,
commands are rather proxied other ssh when using a remote hypervisor (
reasons beeing to prevent mismatch of version between local and remote
docker and because enabling remote access for docker is considered
insecure and needs some uncommon additional steps )

Finally, note that if using the docker version of kcli against your
local hypervisor , you’ll need to pass a docker socket:

``docker run --rm -v /var/run/libvirt:/var/run/libvirt -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock karmab/kcli``

Ansible support
---------------

You can check klist.py in the extra directory and use it as a dynamic
inventory for ansible. It’s also present at
``/usr/share/doc/kcli/extras/klist.py`` in the rpm and
``/usr/bin/klist.py`` in the container

The script uses sames conf as kcli (and as such defaults to local if no
configuration file is found).

vm will be grouped by plan, or put in the kvirt group if they dont
belong to any plan.

Interesting thing is that the script will try to guess the type of vm
based on its template, if present, and populate ansible_user accordingly

Try it with:

.. code:: shell

    python extras/klist.py --list
    ansible all -i extras/klist.py -m ping

If you’re using kcli as a container, you will have to create a script
such as the following to properly call the inventory

::

    #!/bin/bash
    docker run -it --security-opt label:disable -v ~/.kcli:/root/.kcli -v /var/run/libvirt:/var/run/libvirt --entrypoint=/usr/bin/klist.py karmab/kcli $@

Additionally, there are ansible kcli modules in `this
repo <https://github.com/karmab/ansible-kcli-modules>`__, with sample
playbooks:

-  kvirt_vm allows you to create/delete vm (based on an existing profile
   or a template)
-  kvirt_plan allows you to create/delete a plan
-  kvirt_product allows you to create/delete a product (provided you
   have a product repository configured)
-  kvirt_info allows you to retrieve a dict of values similar to
   ``kcli info`` output. You can select which fields to gather

Those modules rely on python3 so you will need to pass
``-e 'ansible_python_interpreter=path_to_python3'`` to your
ansible-playbook invocations ( or set it in your inventory) if your
default ansible installation is based on python2

Both kvirt_vm, kvirt_plan and kvirt_product support overriding
parameters

::

    - name: Deploy fission with additional parameters
      kvirt_product:
        name: fission
        product: fission
        parameters:
         fission_type: all
         docker_disk_size: 10

Finally, you can use the key ansible within a profile

.. code:: yaml

    ansible:
     - playbook: frout.yml
       verbose: true
       variables:
        - x: 8
        - z: 12

In a plan file, you can also define additional sections with the ansible
type and point to your playbook, optionally enabling verbose and using
the key hosts to specify a list of vms to run the given playbook
instead. You wont define variables in this case, as you can leverage
host_vars and groups_vars directory for this purpose

.. code:: yaml

    myplay:
     type: ansible
     verbose: false
     playbook: prout.yml

When leveraging ansible this way, an inventory file will be generated on
the fly for you and let in */tmp/$PLAN.inv*

Using products
--------------

To easily share plans, you can make use of the products feature which
leverages them

Repos
~~~~~

You first add a repo containing a KMETA file with yaml info about
products you want to expose. For instance, mine

::

    kcli repo -u https://github.com/karmab/kcli-plans karmab

You can also update later a given repo, to refresh its KMETA file ( or
all the repos, if not specifying any)

::

    kcli repo --update REPO_NAME

You can delete a given repo with

::

    kcli repo -d REPO_NAME

Product
~~~~~~~

Once you have added some repos, you can list available products, and get
their description

::

    kcli list --products 

You can also get direct information on the product (memory and cpu used,
number of vms deployed and all parameters that can be overriden)

::

    kcli product --info YOUR_PRODUCT 

And deploy any product . Deletion is currently handled by deleting the
corresponding plan

::

    kcli product YOUR_PRODUCT

Running on kubernetes/openshift
-------------------------------

You can run the container on those platforms and either use the web
interface or log in the pod to run ``kcli`` commandline

on kubernetes

::

    kubectl create configmap kcli-config --from-file=~/.kcli
    kubectl create configmap ssh-config --from-file=~/.ssh
    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karmab/kcli/master/extras/k8sdeploy.yml

on openshift, you’ll need to run those extra commands

::

    oc new-project kcli
    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:kcli:default
    oc expose svc kcli

on the web interface, you won’t be able to switch to a different
provider. You would have to modify the configmap to point to a different
provider and recreate the pod

alternatively, look at https://github.com/karmab/kcli-controller for a
controller handling machines crds and creating vms with kcli/kvirt
library

Testing
-------

Basic testing can be run with pytest. If using a remote client, you ll
want to set the *KVIRT_HOST* and *KVIRT_USER* environment variables so
that it points to your client with the corresponding user.

Specific parameters for a client
================================

-  *host* Defaults to 127.0.0.1
-  *port*
-  *user* Defaults to root
-  *protocol* Defaults to ssh
-  *url* can be used to specify an exotic qemu url
-  *tunnel* Defaults to False. Setting it to true will make kcli use
   tunnels for console and for ssh access. You want that if you only
   open ssh port to your client!
-  *planview* Defaults to False. Setting it to true will make kcli use
   the value specified in *~/.kcli/plan* as default plan upon starting
   and stopping plan. Additionally, vms not belonging to the set plan
   wont show up when listing
-  *keep_networks* Defaults to False. Setting it to true will make kcli
   keeps networks when deleting plan

Available parameters for client/profile/plan files
==================================================

-  *cpumodel* Defaults to Westmere
-  *cpuflags* (optional). You can specify a list of strings with
   features to enable or use dict entries with *name* of the feature and
   *enable* either set to True or False. The value for vmx is ignored,
   as it s handled by the nested flag
-  *numcpus* Defaults to 2
-  *memory* Defaults to 512M
-  *flavor* For gcp, aws and openstack, You can specify an existing
   flavor so that cpu and memory is derived from it
-  *guestid* Defaults to guestrhel764
-  *pool* Defaults to default
-  *template* Should point to your base cloud image(optional). You can
   either specify short name or complete path. If you omit the full path
   and your image lives in several pools, the one from last
   (alphabetical) pool will be used.
-  *disksize* Defaults to 10GB
-  *diskinterface* Defaults to virtio. You can set it to ide if using
   legacy operating systems
-  *diskthin* Defaults to True
-  *disks* Array of disks to define. For each of them, you can specify
   pool, size, thin (as boolean), interface (either ide or virtio) and a
   wwn.If you omit parameters, default values will be used from config
   or profile file (You can actually let the entire entry blank or just
   indicate a size number directly)
-  *iso* (optional)
-  *nets* Array of networks to define. For each of them, you can specify
   just a string for the name, or a dict containing name, public and
   alias and ip, mask and gateway
-  *gateway* (optional)
-  *dns* (optional) Dns servers
-  *domain* (optional) Dns search domain
-  *start* Defaults to true
-  *vnc* Defaults to false (use spice instead)
-  *cloudinit* Defaults to true
-  *reserveip* Defaults to false
-  *reservedns* Defaults to false
-  *reservehost* Defaults to false
-  *keys* (optional). Array of ssh public keys to inject to th vm
-  *cmds* (optional). Array of commands to run
-  *profile* name of one of your profile. Only checked in plan file
-  *scripts* array of paths of custom script to inject with cloudinit.
   It will be merged with cmds parameter. You can either specify full
   paths or relative to where you’re running kcli. Only checked in
   profile or plan file
-  *nested* Defaults to True
-  *sharedkey* Defaults to False. Set it to true so that a
   private/public key gets shared between all the nodes of your plan.
   Additionally, root access will be allowed
-  *privatekey* Defaults to False. Set it to true so that your private
   key is passed to the nodes of your plan. If you need this, you know
   why :)
-  *files* (optional)- Array of files to inject to the vm. For ecach of
   the them , you can specify path, owner ( root by default) ,
   permissions (600 by default ) and either origin or content to gather
   content data directly or from specified origin
-  *insecure* (optional) Handles all the ssh option details so you dont
   get any warnings about man in the middle
-  *client* (optional) Allows you to create the vm on a specific client.
   This field is not used for other types like network, so expect to use
   this in relatively simple plans only
-  *base* (optional) Allows you to point to a parent profile so that
   values are taken from parent when not found in the current profile.
   Scripts and commands are rather concatenated between default, father
   and children ( so you have a happy family…)
-  *tags* (optional) Array of tags to apply to gcp instances (usefull
   when matched in a firewall rule). In the case of kubevirt, it s
   rather a dict of key=value used as node selector (allowing to force
   vms to be scheduled on a matching node)
-  \ *rhnregister*\  (optional). Auto registers vms whose template
   starts with rhel Defaults to false. Requires to either rhnuser and
   rhnpassword, or rhnactivationkey and rhnorg, and an optional rhnpool
-  *rhnuser* (optional). Red Hat network user
-  *rhnpassword* (optional). Red Hat network password
-  *rhnactivationkey* (optional). Red Hat network activation key
-  *rhnorg* (optional). Red Hat network organization
-  *rhnpool* (optional). Red Hat network pool
-  *enableroot* (optional). Defaults to true. Allows ssh access as root
   user
-  *storemetadata* (optional). Defaults to false. creates a
   /root/.metadata yaml file whith all the overrides applied. On gcp,
   those overrides are also stored as extra metadata

Overriding parameters
---------------------

You can override parameters in

-  commands
-  scripts
-  files
-  plan files
-  profiles

For that , you can pass in kcli vm or kcli plan the following
parameters:

-  -P x=1 -P y=2 and so on
-  –paramfile - In this case, you provide a yaml file ( and as such can
   provide more complex structures )

The indicated objects are then rendered using jinja.

::

    centos:
     template: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
     cmds:
      - echo x={{ x }} y={{ y }} >> /tmp/cocorico.txt
      - echo {{ password | default('unix1234') }} | passwd --stdin root

You can make the previous example cleaner by using the special key
parameters in your plans and define there variables

::

    parameters:
     password: unix1234
     x: coucou
     y: toi
    centos:
     template: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
     cmds:
      - echo x={{ x }} y={{ y }} >> /tmp/cocorico.txt
      - echo {{ password  }} | passwd --stdin root

Finally note that you can also use advanced jinja constructs like
conditionals and so on. For instance:

::

    parameters:
      net1: default
    vm4:
      template: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
      nets:
        - {{ net1 }}
    {% if net2 is defined %}
        - {{ net2 }}
    {% endif %}

Also, you can reference a *baseplan* file in the *parameters* section,
so that parameters are concatenated between the base plan file and the
current one

::

    parameters:
       baseplan: upstream.yml
       xx_version: v0.7.0

Api Usage
=========

You can also use kvirt library directly, without the client or to embed
it into your own application. Here’s a sample

::

    from kvirt.config import Kconfig
    config = Kconfig()
    k = config.k

You can then either use config for high level actions or the more low
level k object
