This tool is meant to interact with a local/remote libvirt daemon and to
easily deploy from templates (using cloudinit). It will also report IPS
for any vm connected to a dhcp-enabled libvirt network and generally for
every vm deployed from this client. Futhermore, you can deploy vms using
defined profiles or several at once using plans There is support for
gcp, aws, kubevirt and ovirt

Refer to the `documentation <https://kcli.readthedocs.io>`__ for more
information
