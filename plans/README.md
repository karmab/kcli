## Plans deployment 

As an advanced use of kcli, i have created a deployment plan and specific scripts that will deploy the following elements.

- openstack rdo
- ovirt
- manageiq
- openshift origin
- foreman

Note that a single vm is deployed for every project and as such all services are provided in a "allinone" fashion


## Installation

- The deployment makes use of your private default routed network on your libvirt host, with dhcp,  using 192.168.122.0, reserving ips starting from `192.168.5.200` as openstack floating ip pool. You can then use the plan files and scripts in the [plans](https://github.com/karmab/kcli/tree/master/plans) directory

~~~sh
kcli plan -f uci.yml uci
~~~

## I want rhci

Provided you have the subscriptions, you can save the sample [register.sh script](register.sh) to your home directory, edit it to match your credentials and pool info and launch the deployment:

~~~sh
kcli plan -f rhci.yml rhci
~~~

## Launching single product 

You can also easily launch individual upstream/downstream product directly from the corresponding directory . For instance to launch upstream ovirt, run the following commands (optionally specifying a plan name)

~~~sh
cd plans/ovirt
kcli plan -f upstream.yml
~~~
You can do the same for downstream. Note that for openstack, there are per version downstream plan files to ease testing ( currently kilo, liberty and mitaka )


## Limitations 

- Using static networking with rhel/centos cloud images is complicated as those images are per default configured to have a single dhcp nic. Best Solution is to run virt-customize in those images to enable BOOTPROTO=static
- I had issues injecting cloudinit beyond network configuration in the manageiq image. Ideally one would use appliance_console_cli and curl calls to set it up, but it refuses to work....
